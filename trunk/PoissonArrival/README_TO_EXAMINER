To Examiner: 
	Because of the space limitation, I did not include the event trace files and 
	load balancer, server nodes's trace files in this tar ball.
	Those traces files are used while evaluate the simulation framework. 
	This tar ball only contains essential files to make the project complied. 

	An complete code based including the event traces, report trace and results are
	located on the netos research group web server.
