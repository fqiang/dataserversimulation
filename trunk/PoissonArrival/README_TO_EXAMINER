To Examiner: 
	Because of the space limitation, I did not include the event trace files, 
	load balancer and server node trace files in this tar ball. You could use
	the following svn checkout/update command to get the trace files.
	Those trace files are created/generated by the program while I am conducting 
	the evaluation of the simulation framework.
	
	Recommend to svn update by:
		run "svn update" in trace folder and report folder
	
	However a new version can be checkout from google code server.
		run "svn checkout https://dataserversimulation.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ <DIRECTOR>
