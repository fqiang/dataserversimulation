To Examiner: 
	Because of the space limitation, I did not include the event trace files folder, 
	load balancer and server node trace files (report folder) in this tar ball. 
	This tar ball only contains essential files to make the project complied. 
	
	You could use the following svn checkout/update command to get the trace and report 
	folder. Those trace files under trace folder are generated by the request event 
	generator while I am conducting evaluation of the simulation framework.
	
	Recommend to svn update by:
		run "svn update" in project home directory
	
	However a new version can be checkout from google code server.
		run "svn checkout https://dataserversimulation.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ <DEST_DIRECTOR>
